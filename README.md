# freedom-mobile-api-client

## Introduction

Short pre-amble: I was trying to write an API library so that I could write a quick iOS/Android app (god forbid anyone uses the official app -- it's a joke), but never got beyond ~2/3rds of the authentication process.

## Notes

- I no longer have a Freedom Mobile line, so the project will be a big WIP.
- You're limited to a small number of reqs. before you have to wait for 24 hours (rate limiting on the phone #, not just IP)
